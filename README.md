# SCAP-SUSE-SLES11
SCAP OVAL Definition for SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11

### Why create a SCAP OVAL file yourself instead of SUSE?
Because I can. And because noone else did. Satisfied?

### Does it work?
Yes, but it's not 100%.

### Can I use this in scanners, i.e. SCC?
Well, it's not digitally signed, but if you ignore import warnings it *should* work.

### Why not use OpenSCAP?
You can, but I can't. That's why.
